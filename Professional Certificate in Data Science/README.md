# Professional Certificate in Data Science
#### A program by the Harvard on EdX

[View Program Accomplishments](https://credentials.edx.org/records/programs/shared/92e3d3daba6c4ba4afbd556b8cb5c8e9/) | [View Program on EdX](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) 

A 9-course program covering concepts of Data Science, including probability, inference, regression, and Machine Learning. This program builds towards applications of these concepts in data wrangling, visualization, and formal publication of reproducible research. Coursework, assignments, and final capstone projects are done in `R`, using common popular tools such as `ggplot2`, `dplyr` and the entire `tidyverse`, `rMarkdown` with `knittr`, and the `caret` for Machine Learning.

The program culminates in a pair of capstone projects: a Movie Recommendation system based on the `MovieLens` dataset, and a "Fake News" text analysis algorithm.

[View Certificate](Course%20Certificates/PH125.9x%20Capstone.pdf) | [View Course on EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-capstone)

Application of previous 8 courses' material on two major projects .

#### Movie Recommendation System, using the MovieLens 10M dataset
An application of the `Recosystem::recommender` and a bespoke implementation of the "Slope-One" algorithm. Topics include normalization of multiple factor effects, big data processing challenges, and parallelized computing.

#### "Fake News" Prediction using
An application of Random Forests on three English Lexicons for sentiment analysis to predict "real" and "fake" news from article and headline content. Topics include `ngram` tokenization, differing measures of sentiment provided by different lexicons, Support Vector Machines, the limitations of small and biased datasets for this type of analysis.
